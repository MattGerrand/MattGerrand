Hi, I'm Matt Gerrand. I am currently perusing a Bachelor of Information Sciences (major in Software Engineering, minor in Accountancy) at Massey University. I am also looking at expanding my knowledge in the Computer Science subject by completing a Masters of Computer Science or Information Sciences (still undecided on which one). On the side while studying full time I have been a freelance Software Engineer working for myself providing services for multiple local businesses.
