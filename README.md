Hi, I'm Matt Gerrand. I am currently finishing a Bachelor of Information Sciences (major in Software Engineering, minor in Accountancy) at Massey University while also starting a Master of Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington. On the side while studying full-time I was a freelance Software Engineer working for myself providing services for multiple local businesses. In my 4th year of study I started working at Plumbing World part-time, which is my current job.
